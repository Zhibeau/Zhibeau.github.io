# Goals of documentation and reporting
- to produce evidence for the client to attempt to troubleshoot an issue.
- to not scramble to re-do testing after losing evidence or ask a client for more time
- to cover ourselves because any network issues during a penetration test to be blamed on the tester regardless of whether it is a result of their activities.

# Notetaking
## Concept of notetaking:
*Notetaking: collection of piece-wise evidence that will could be put into the final report.*
## Notetaking Sample Structure:
- Attack Path: An outline of the entire path if you gain a foothold during an external penetration test or compromise one or more hosts (or the AD domain)
- Credentials
- Findings: screenshots and command outputs that are valuable to keep 
- Vulnerability Scan Research 
- Service Enumeration Research: investigation including failed exploitation
- Web Application Research: web applications including subdomain brute-forcing, scan for common web ports on internal assessments, and run a tool such as Aquatone or EyeWitness to screenshot all applications.
- AD Enumeration Research
- OSINT 
- Administrative Information: contact information for other project stakeholders like Project Managers (PMs) or client Points of Contact (POCs), unique objectives/flags defined in the Rules of Engagement (RoE), etc.
- Scoping Information: in-scope IP addresses/CIDR ranges, web application URLs, and any credentials for web applications, VPN, or AD provided by the client.
- Activity Log: High-level tracking of everything you did during the assessment for possible event correlation.
- Payload Log: payloads used (and a file hash for anything uploaded and the upload location)

# Tmux logging
*Save every single thing that we type into a Tmux pane to a log file.*
