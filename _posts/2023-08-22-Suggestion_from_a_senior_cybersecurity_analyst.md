Claude Sam-Foh's suggestions on beginning the career in cybersecurity

Core concept: Do more than security
1. Think about you want to do technology side or buissiness side of the cybersecurity
2. Focus on the breeds of experience, build the scope, move horizontally
e.g. architechture, ChatGPT, Organization changement, Privacy, Service management
3. Learning fast, learning continously, be adaptive
4. Make plans for learning, growing, sharing the knowledge
